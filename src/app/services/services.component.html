    <h1>Behavior Driven Development</h1>
    <p>To assure quality, first you must define it. What does it look like when your application works? Welcome to BDD. We'll get you up to speed.</p>

    <h1>Test Writing</h1>
    <p>However you like to write tests, we've got you covered. We can train your team the BDD language Cucumber, or work with you in your favorite framework.</p>

    <h1>agile Development</h1>
    <p>As <a href="https://pragdave.me/">Dave Thomas</a> says, agile shouldn't have a capital A, because then it's a product, not a process. Whatever your process, we can teach you to integrate comprehensive testing.</p>

    <h1>Test It All</h1>
    <p>QA should be flexible, not tied to a specific platform, language, or development framework. Our technologies let you test your code, however you put it out in the world.</p>

    <h1>Webdriver and Selenium</h1>
    <p>Selenium is the standard in browser automation. Cutting-edge frameworks like <a href="www.webdriver.io">Webdriver.io</a> make it easier to use, and let developers write their tests in the same code they write your app.</p>

    <h1>AWS</h1>
    <p>Why just run tests at the desktop? Deploy your test platform to the cloud to enable Continuous Integration. End-to-end coverage with every commit.</p>

    <h1>Docker</h1>
    <p>Great QA requires consistency. Running your tests in a Docker container ensures the same environment, every time, so you can trust the test results.</p>

    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>Testing is universal. Whether your app is written with a cutting edge platform like Angular2/TypeScript, funky Golang, or good old Java, we can handle it. And if we don't know it, we'll learn it.</p>
